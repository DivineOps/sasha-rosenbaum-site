This post is my voice, my personal view of the current situation in Ukraine. Even though I am personally safe, I am experiencing some degree of fear posting these words. I am free to speak my mind because I live in a democratic country, and I don't have close relatives in Russia who could be threatened to silence me. Many of my friends are not so lucky.

# What is happening

As of today, the Russian military is leading an all-out war on Ukraine. They have invaded Ukraine on [multiple fronts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine#24_February), and are [bombing cities all over the country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_engagements_during_the_2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine). Russia is using [Belarus as a base and is aided by Belarusian troops](https://kyivindependent.com/national/sources-belarus-to-join-russias-war-on-ukraine-within-hours/).

[Civilian targets](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/01/ukraine-russia-babyn-yar/) all over Ukraine are under fire. People spend days in [makeshift bomb shelters](https://www.npr.org/2022/02/28/1083421199/those-who-havent-fled-ukraine-hunker-down-in-make-shift-bomb-shelters). [Civilians are killed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/children-teachers-civilian-casualties-of-the-ukraine-conflict). 

Even with many [EU borders open to Ukrainian refugees](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/02/27/ukraine-refugees-photos-videos/), most people cannot flee the country.  

[![map of recent attacks](map-ua.png)](https://liveuamap.com/)

There are Over 40 million people in Ukraine. 40 million people under fire.

*As I write these words, I am terrified that at any moment Putin may win. If he does, my friends and family might be killed or jailed, and I will have no means of helping them. If he does, I can never again visit the places where I or my family were born*

**Putin's goal is a new Soviet Union**

This war is much bigger than a single country invasion. 

In his [speech](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/2/23/22945781/russia-ukraine-putin-speech-transcript-february-22) prior to the invasion of Ukraine, Putin said that the break of USSR was "the greatest geo-political catasrophe or the 21 century" and that he wants the NATO borders back at the 9X level. 

Leaked information suggests that Putin intends to instate a puppet pro-Russian government over Ukraine. If he succeeds, there will no longer be anything that the West can do to stop him from forming a new version of USSR. 

**The world leaders are abandoning Ukraine to fight alone**

Putin is holding the world hostage with his finger on the nuclear button.

I am not a country leader. I am not privvy to classified intel. I am guessing that somewhere behind the scenes Russia is threatening the world leaders that they will unleash nuclear weapons if any other country provides military aid to Ukraine. 

I have no other explanation for what is happening. 

NATO has the power to create an iron dome above Ukraine, preventing air strikes. NATO has the technology to intercept Russian attacks without deploying a single soldier. 

Yet NATO is doing NOTHING. 

The West is using Ukraine as a live shield, letting Ukrainian women and children die. 

History shows us that dictators don't stop while winning. If the world does nothing to save Ukraine, what's to stop Putin from using the same nuclear threat to invade Latvia, Lithuania or Estonia, Georgia or Kazakhstan, or any other of the former USSR republics? 

**This is a broken promise** 

When the Soviet Union broke down, Ukraine had its own nuclear weapons. These weapons were dismantled under a guarantee of the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, et al to [peace in Ukraine](https://theintercept.com/2022/02/27/ukraine-nuclear-weapons-russia-invasion/).

I was there. A family friend was working as a translator for the American workers in Dnipro whose job it was to oversee the disarmment. I think even as a kid I questioned if anyone would really come to aid us if we were under attack. I never once thought that the attack would be by our brothers and sisters...


**Ukraine cannot hold against Russian and Belorussian military without help**

The world leaders keep giving inspirational speeches about the tough people of Ukraine. 

No matter how tough Ukrainians are, or how committed they are to their freedom, they do not have enough human resources, funds, or military equipment to hold off Russia and Belarus joint invasion. 

Economic sanctions will not save Ukraine today. 

**Putin isn't Russia**

There are many people in Russia who support Putin's agenda. The levels of state propaganda in both Russia and Belorus are such that many ordinary citizens believe that Russians are invading to "liberate" Ukraine. 

Still, there are many people in Russia who do not support Putin, or this war. 

Many of my friends who oppose the war are afraid to speak up, afraid to go to protests, afraid to post on social media due to risk of prosecution. Russia is almost at the former USSR level of freedom of speech supression. People are arrested for laying flowers at monuments TODO. Fired for speaking out against the war TODO. The last remaining independent media has been shut down over the conflict coverage TODO. 

Even those who aren't in Russia are keeping quiet because their families are begging them to. Do you ever wonder what it would be like to fear an arrest over speaking up? Over someone else in your family speaking up? 

# Why you should care

You are in North America, Europe, or Asia, your family is safe and Putin isn't at your door. Why should you care? 

1. Innocent people are dying
2. If Putin succeeds at reinstating USSR, the Western world is facing another cold war
3. History tells us that dictators are unlikely to stop while winning

# How you can help

Please don't walk away. Do something right now, however little, to support Ukraine. 

## Donate

There are many charities and support organizations that are doing life saving work right now in Ukraine. Some of them were created in the course of the past few days as the country rallies to support military and civilians. If you have personal friends in need of assistance or friends running aid organizations, please donate directly. Otherwise, I am highlighting a few verified organizations. 

### National Bank of Ukraine Armed Forces Fund
Ukrainian armed forces are lacking basic equipment, clothing, weapons, food. The only way Ukraine can hold is by reinforcing the military. The NBU had spun up a special fundraising account for Ukrainian armed forces which is open to PayPal donations and wire transfers. Donate [here](https://bank.gov.ua/en/news/all/natsionalniy-bank-vidkriv-spetsrahunok-dlya-zboru-koshtiv-na-potrebi-armiyi).

### Humanitarian aid charities
[Nova Ukraine](https://novaukraine.org/donate/) - A non-profit organization dedicated to raising awareness about Ukraine in the US and throughout the world and providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine.

[Razom for Ukraine](https://razomforukraine.org/donate/) - Razom, which means “together” in Ukrainian, believes deeply in the enormous potential of dedicated volunteers around the world united by a single goal: to unlock the potential of Ukraine.

Both of these are registered 501(c)(3) organizations, which are tax-exempt in the US. Both are registered with Benevity - you check if your company offers a donation match.

## Speak up

Stay informed. Share verified information on social media. Go to pro-Ukrainian rallies. Carry a Ukrainian flag. 

Your support matters.

Every one of my Ukrainian friends, both those in Ukraine who are under fire, and those who are currently in other countries has shared that they feel that the world has abandoned us. 

Your support matters. 

## Reach out to your Government

There are many, many things Western countries can do to defend Ukraine. Please find your local government official and 

1. Ask them to help Ukraine with funds, armor, weapons, food and supplies.
2. Ask them to create a no-fly zone over Ukraine
3. Ask them to aid Ukraine with troops. 
4. Ask that they freeze Russian funds and assets. 

If you’re in the US you can use the [weStandWithUkraine](https://supportukrainenow.org/influence-authorities-directly) bot on Telegram to find your local representatives and how to communicate with them.
