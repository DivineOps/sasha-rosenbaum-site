<img src="summary.jpg" alt="Stand with Ukraine"  />

This post is my personal view of the current situation in Ukraine. Even though I am personally safe, I am experiencing some degree of fear posting these words. I am free to speak my mind because I live in a democratic country, and I don't have close relatives in Russia who could be threatened to silence me. Many of my friends are not so lucky.

# What is happening

As of today, Russian military is leading an all-out war on Ukraine. They have invaded Ukraine on multiple fronts TODO, and are bombing cities all over the country TODO. Russia is using Belorus as a base and is aided by Belorussian troops TODO. 

Civilian targets all over Ukraine are under fire TODO. People spend days in makeshift bomb shelters TODO. Civilians are killed TODO. 

Even with many EU borders open to Ukrainian refugees TODO, most people cannot flee the country.  

TODO map of targets

There are 40+ TODO million people in Ukraine. 40 million people under fire.

As I write these words, I am terrified that at any moment Putin may win. If he does, I will be cut off from helping friends and family, cut off from seeing my home ever again. 

**Putin goal is a new Soviet Union**
This war is much bigger than a single country invasion. 

In his speech prior to invasion of Ukraine TODO, Putin said that the break of USSR was "the greatest geo-political catasrophe or the 21 century" TODO and that he wants the NATO borders back at the 9X level TODO. 

Leaked information suggests that Putin intends to instate a puppet pro-Russian government over Ukraine. If he succeeds, there will no longer be anything that the West can do to stop him from forming a new version of USSR. 

**The world leaders are abandoning Ukraine to fight alone**

Putin is holding the world hostage with his finger on the nuclear button.

I am not a country leader. I am not privvy to classified intel. I am guessing that somewhere behind the scenes Russia is threatening the world leaders that they will unleash nuclear weapons if any other country provides military aid to Ukraine. 

I have no other explanation for what is happening. 

NATO has the power to create an iron dome above Ukraine, preventing air strikes. NATO has the power to stop civilians from dying. 

Yet NATO is doing NOTHING.

History shows us that dictators don't stop when they are winning. If the world does nothing to save Ukraine, what's to stop Putin from using the same nuclear threat to invade Latvia, Lithuania or Estonia, Kasakhstan or Georgia or any other of the former USSR republics? TODO

**This is a broken promise** 

When the Soviet Union broke down, Ukraine had its own nuclear weapons. These weapons were dismantled under a guarantee of the United States, X and Russia to guarantee peace in Ukraine. TODO

I was there. A family friend was working as a translator for the American workers in Dnipro whose job it was to oversee the disarmment. I think even as a kid I questioned if anyone would really come to aid us if we were under attack. I never once thought that the attack would be by our brothers and sisters...


**Ukraine cannot hold against Russian and Belorussian military without help**
The world leaders keep giving inspirational speeches about the tough people of Ukraine. 

No matter how tough Ukrainians are, or how committed they are to their freedom, they do not have enough human resources, funds, or military equipment to hold off Russia and Belorus joint invasion. 

Economic sanctions are helpful. But they aren't sufficient to save Ukraine from demolition today. 

**Putin isn't Russia**

There are many people in Russia who support Putin's agenda. There are many (perhaps a majority?) who don't. 

Many of my friends who oppose the war are afraid to speak up, afraid to go to protests, afraid to post on social media due to risk of prosecution. Russia is almost at the level of USSR level of freedom of speech supression. People are arrested for laying flowers at monuments TODO. Fired for speaking out against the war TODO. The remaining independent media has been shut down over the conflict coverage TODO. 

Even those who aren't in Russia are keeping quiet because their families are begging them to. Do you ever wonder what it would be like to fear an arrest over speaking up? Over someone else in your family speaking up? 

# Why you should care

You are in North America, Europe, or Asia, your family is safe and Putin isn't at your door. Why should you care? 

1. Innocent people are dying
2. If Putin succeeds at reinstating USSR, the Western world is facing another cold war
3. History tells us that dictators are unlikely to stop while winning

# How you can help

## Donate

There are many charities and support organizations that are doing life saving work right now in Ukraine. Some of them were created in the course of the past few days as the country rallies to support military and civilians. If you have personal friends in need of assistance or friends running aid organizations, please donate directly. Otherwise, I am highlighting a few verified organizations. 

### National Bank of Ukraine Armed Forces Fund
Ukrainian armed forces are lacking basic equipment, clothing, weapons, food. The only way Ukraine can hold is by reinforcing the military. The NBU had spun up a special fundraising account for Ukrainian armed forces which is open to PayPal donations and wire transfers. Donate here TODO

### Humanitarian aid charities
Nova Ukraine is a humanitarian aid organization TODO

Razom for Ukraine TODO

Both of these are registered 501(c)(3) organizations, which are tax-exempt in the US. Both are registered with Benevity - you check if your company offers a donation match.

### Additional verified links
TODO

TODO one more action item

## Speak up

Share information on social media. Go to protests. Carry a Ukrainian flag. TODO more specific actions

Your support matters.

I traveled twice through the US while carrying a Ukrainian flag. Only two folks have stopped me to express support. Do you know how alone I feel looking at people celebrating life while my country is dying alone?
