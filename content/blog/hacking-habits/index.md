<!-- *I read **a lot** of Audiobooks. The best books are shortcuts to knowledge acquired through experience. They leave me with a revelation about the world.  I would like to share some of these revelations with you.* -->

I have always been fascinated by what BJ Fogg calls "behavior design" and have read quite a few books on it - "The Power of Habit", "Atomic Habits", "Nudge", Allen Carr's "The Easy Way to Control Alcohol". So far, none came closer to giving me the feeling that I am “hacking the source code” of my own behavior than BJ Fogg’s “Tiny Habits.”

I found lots of good ideas in the book, including two that are causing me to look at human behavior in a new way. The kind of ideas I call "revelations".

First, the premise.

# B = MAP
According to Fogg, behavior can be expressed as a simple formula.
B = MAP
Meaning that behavior equals motivation + ability + prompt.

Here is a revelation: when we are debugging the behavior, we are doing it  wrong! More specifically, we are approaching it in the wrong order. 

I have lived in 3 different countries with very different cultures. In every single one, the common wisdom tells you that to change behavior, you need to affect motivation. Whether you are trying to influence yourself, your team at work, or your child, the primary strategy is to offer either carrot (promise a reward) or a stick (threaten a punishment) to increase someone’s motivation to do the behavior. 

Worse than that. We escalate from labeling an action, to labeling a habit, to labeling an identity very quickly. How quickly does your personal self-talk go from “I didn’t exercise today” to “I can never get myself to exercise” to “I’m a f@t f#ck”? The further you go down this path, the harder it is to come back.


# The Action line
The Action Line is the chart showing 

Notice the asymptotic tails. The easier the behavior is to do, the less motivation you need to do it. The more motivation you have to do the behavior, the more challenges you are able to overcome.

Motivation, however, is a fickle mistress. A much better strategy, researched by BJ Fogg and others, is to start debugging the behavior at the other end of the B = MAP formula. 

Can’t get yourself to start the desired behavior? Design a good prompt. 

Design a reminder that matches the location and TODO of the behavior. Fit it into your existing routine. Often, this is all it takes.

Next up is ability.

Have a good prompt but still unable to do the behavior? Increase your physical or mental ability to perform it. Don’t trust yourself to overcome hurdles. Purposely reduce any friction to do the behavior. Make it easy to do the right thing. 

This is also where the habits being “tiny” comes in. It is a lot easier to do a single wall pushup than 20 good form floor pushups. BJ Fogg suggests that you should aim for the “tiny” core habit that you could execute on on your very worst day, a day when you have a toothache, a TODO and your house is on fire. If you are still able to do the behavior on your worst day, you are usually happy to do a much more elaborate version of the behavior on your best. 

# Celebration

Only the very best books leave me with more than one revelation, and Tiny Habits was one of those. 

As useful as the B = MAP formula has been, the most significant idea in the book for me is the importance of celebration. 

BJ Fogg points out that as adults, we tend to never celebrate our tiny successes. Worse than that, we dismiss our accomplishments with the mental track of “finally”, or “this is not enough”, or “you should have done this a week ago”. 

According to Fogg’s research, the key to changing behavior is TODO celebrating success. Every time you do a desired action, no matter how small it seems, celebrate. Spend a moment authentically congratulating yourself on accomplishing a goal. 

Seems silly or undeserved? Think about this. If I were training a dog to sit on a sit command, what would it do if instead of giving it a treat for executing the behavior, I’d spank it for “not doing it well enough”? I bet you the dog would avoid the behavior like the plague. 

But this is exactly what you do to your “lizard brain” when you tell yourself that “I’m just phoning it in” after a wall push up. At the end of the day, we are simple creatures. If we get discouragement for the wall push up, we aren’t going to take on the harder versions of the behavior. 

Just as with the behavior debugging sequence, the common cultural approach seems to be quite wrong here. We are naturally inclined to give ourselves and others negative reinforcements rather than positive ones. Worse than that, we are taught that we can somehow “spoil” people by too much positive feedback. One of the phrases from the book that has really stuck with me is “I change best by feeling good, not by feeling bad”. 

Personally, I have taken the idea of celebration a bit further than habit hacking.

The time since the beginning of the pandemic has been personally quite difficult for me, as I know they have been for many of you. One of the things that happened is the general feeling of burn out and overwhelm, not just in work, but in life. I’ve gotten to a point where absolutely everything felt like a chore. 

I have decided to test what happens if I celebrate every positive behavior I do, be it a one-time thing or a habit, work or life related, no matter how tiny. Unlike buying yourself a reward dinner, authentic celebration is free, always accessible, and comes with no extra calories. What’s the worst that could happen?

It’s been a few weeks since I’ve read the book, and I can attest to feeling a lot less burnt out. Somehow, it is a lot easier to wipe off the dinner table if you give yourself a pat on the back for doing it. Somehow, everything in life feels lighter and more fun if you celebrate the tiny positive outcomes. 

Try it. See if it work for you.

There are a lot more details, examples, and suggestions in the book that I could never do justice in a short blog. If you are interested in habit-hacking, I highly recommend reading the book. TODO affiliate link?
