The slides to my <a href="https://www.chicagocodecamp.com/Presenters/Presenter/2499" target=_blank> Chicago Code Camp 2018</a> presentation on Azure Serverless DevOps are on <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/AlexandraRosenbaum/serverless-devops-chicago-code-camp-2018" target=_blank>SlideShare</a>. Unfortunately they do not include the demo, so you will have to learn about the continuous integration and delivery and the developer experience for Azure Functions from the resources links!
